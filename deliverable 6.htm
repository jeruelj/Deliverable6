	<h2><center>About Me</center></h2>	
	<p><center>Hello friends, my name is Jeruel John. I am a photographer based out of Tampa, FL. I started capturing the presence of musicians in April 2018. During that time, I have learned quite a bit from the experiences. Many people in the reggae scene, where I am from, inspired me to do what I love to do. Some of those brands/people include, but are not limited to the Sugarshack, Snappin Necks, GARRENteed VISUALS, and Smiling Eyes media. Their style peaked my interest quite a bit. Along the way, I developed a style of my own, and that is to make the viewer feel as if they were in the moment with me. Each day that I am alive, I feel grateful to be able to share some content with you. Feel free to send me a message of what you enjoy or what you would like to see. I am always looking to push boundaries and try something new.</center></p>

	<h2><center>Class Projects</center></h2>
	<p><center>I have had a few class projects. The most important ones were where I have used SolidWorks to create a Sputtering Gun chamber. This allowed for a substrate to spin and be encoated evenly in a specified element. </center><p>
